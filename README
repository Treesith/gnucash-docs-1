          GnuCash Docs 1.7.x README file.

NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE!!! THIS VERSION HAS NOT
BEEN TESTED PROPERLY AND MAY DO ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING!  

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK (AND KEEP *LOTS* OF BACKUPS)

If you want something a bit more tested, please use the
1.6 stable series.
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first release of the newly separated docs module from 
the main GnuCash module. These docs are in a state of flux as they
are fine tuned for the final release. They should, however, work 
fine in the GnuCash help browser and if you are running a GNOME2
desktop they should register with Yelp and be accessible from it.

Known Problems
##############

At this time in order to get the docs module out there for people
to give me feedback (please to gnucash-devel@gnucash.org) I had to
release with a few known problems.

-Installing from source will need a net connection

This is because the stylesheet I'm using to do the docs conversion
to html references an external site (www.docbook.org) I'm currently
investigating ways to not need this.

-The index and search for the GnuCash help browser dont work

I had to disable this as part of the move to the new module. I'm 
working on moving this too.

That's it for now! Please do email me or preferably the devel list
with any problems you have.

Thanks
