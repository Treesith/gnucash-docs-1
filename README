############################################################
          GnuCash Docs 1.8.x README file.
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the docs module for GnuCash. The docs can be accessed
with the GnuCash help browser and if you are running a GNOME2
desktop be accessible from Yelp (the GNOME2 help browser).

Requirements
############

libxml2/libxslt
docbook-xsl
scrollkeeper >=0.3.4

Notes
#####

The GnuCash docs team is actively seeking contributors. Even if you
only have time for reviewing or editing the existing docs this can 
help. PLEASE let me know via the gnucash-devel mailing list what
you can work on or help with.

The initial releases of the docs module needed a specific version of
the docbook-xsl stylesheets to work. If this wasn't present on your
system it went online to grab the stylesheets from a website. This 
should no longer happen as the needed stylesheets are now part of this 
distribution. You still need, however, a working docbook-xsl setup to
build and install these docs.

Known Problems
##############

Please send feedback to gnucash-devel@gnucash.org for any difficulties
, hints or suggestions with the docs. There are a few known problems.

- Help documentation missing documentation for multi-currency support,
  Business module and OFX import. Menu description incomplete.

- Guide needs some updates still.

That's it for now! Please report any problems to the GNOME bugzilla at 
http://bugzilla.gnome.org. Or alternately email me or preferably the 
devel list with any problems you have.

Thanks
