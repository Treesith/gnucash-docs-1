          GnuCash Docs 1.7.x README file.

NOTE: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE!!! THIS VERSION HAS NOT
BEEN TESTED PROPERLY AND MAY DO ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING!  

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK (AND KEEP *LOTS* OF BACKUPS)

If you want something a bit more tested, please use the
1.6 stable series.
------------------------------------------------------------

This is the docs module for GnuCash. These docs are in a state of
flux as they are fine tuned for the final release. They should, 
however, work fine in the GnuCash help browser and if you are 
running a GNOME2 desktop they should register with Yelp and be 
accessible from it.

Requirements
############

libxml2/libxslt
scrollkeeper >=0.3.4

Known Problems
##############

At this time in order to get the docs module out there for people
to give me feedback (please to gnucash-devel@gnucash.org) I had to
release with a few known problems.

- Help documentation missing documentation for multi-currency support,
  Business module and OFX import. Menu description incomplete.

- Guide needs updating and re-organization.

That's it for now! Please report any problems to the GNOME bugzilla at 
http://bugzilla.gnome.org. or alternatly email me or preferably the 
devel list with any problems you have.

Thanks
