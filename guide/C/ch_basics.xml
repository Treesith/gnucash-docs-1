  <title>The Basics</title>

  <para>This chapter will introduce some of the basics of using <application>&app;</application>. It is
  recommended that you read through this chapter, before starting to do any
  real work with <application>&app;</application>. Next chapters will begin to show
  you hands on examples.</para>

    <title>Accounting Concepts</title>

    <para><application>&app;</application> is easy enough to use that you do not need to have a
    complete understanding of accounting principles to find it useful.
    However, you will find that some basic accounting knowledge will prove to
    be invaluable as <application>&app;</application> was designed using these principles as a
    template. It is highly recommended that you understand this section of the
    guide before proceeding.</para>

      <title>The 5 Basic Accounts</title>

      <para>Basic accounting rules group all finance related things into 5
      fundamental types of <quote>accounts</quote>. That is, everything that
      accounting deals with can be placed into one of these 5 accounts:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Assets</emphasis> &mdash; things you own.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Liabilities</emphasis> &mdash; things you owe.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Equity</emphasis> &mdash; overall net worth.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Income</emphasis> &mdash; increases the value of your
          accounts.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Expenses</emphasis> &mdash; decreases the value of your
          accounts.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It is clear that it is possible to categorize your financial world
      into these 5 groups. For example, the cash in your bank account is an
      asset, your mortgage is a liability, your paycheck is income, and the
      cost of dinner last night is an expense.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="basics-accountingequation2">
      <title>The Accounting Equation</title>

      <para>With the 5 basic accounts defined, what is the relationship
      between them? How does one type of account affect the others? Firstly,
      equity is defined by assets and liability. That is, your net worth is
      calculated by subtracting your liabilities from your assets:</para>

      <para><emphasis>Assets - Liabilities = Equity</emphasis></para>

      <para>Furthermore, you can increase your equity through income, and
      decrease equity through expenses. This makes sense of course, when you
      receive a paycheck you become "richer" and when you pay for dinner you
      become "poorer". This is expressed mathematically in what is known as
      the Accounting Equation:</para>

      <para><emphasis>Assets - Liabilities = Equity + (Income -
      Expenses)</emphasis></para>

      <para>This equation must always be balanced, a condition that can only
      be satisfied if you enter values to multiple accounts. For example: if
      you receive money in the form of income you must see an equal increase
      in your assets. As another example, you could have an increase in assets
      if you have a parallel increase in liabilities.</para>

    <sect2 id="basics-accountingdouble2">
      <title>Double Entry</title>

      <para>The accounting equation is the very heart of a double entry
      accounting system. For every change in value of one account in the
      Accounting Equation, there must be a balancing change in another. This
      concept is known as the <emphasis>Principle of Balance</emphasis>, and
      is of fundamental importance for understanding <application>&app;</application> and other double
      entry accounting systems. When you work with <application>&app;</application>, you will always be
      concerned with at least 2 accounts, to keep the Accounting Equation
      balanced.</para>

      <para>Double entry accounting serves two purposes. The first is to
      create an accounting trail, money always has to come from somewhere and
      go to somewhere. Additionally, double entry accounting historically
      served to double check the math of an accountant. Because the numbers
      are entered into multiple accounts simultaneously, there are multiple
      places to check to make sure the totals match. Of course, with the
      advent of computers, the chances of a mathematical problem are low, but
      it is good to know that the concept still exists!</para>

      <para>Double entry accounting has been around since the late 15th
      century, when it was described by an Italian friar, Luca Pacioli.
      Traditional double entry accounting involves recording each transaction
      in a book called a ledger, then copying each part of the transaction to
      separate books called journals. This method is still used in businesses
      today as a way to avoid entry errors and to track the source of those
      errors. <application>&app;</application> simplifies this traditional accounting by copying part
      of each transaction for you, so it may not catch some of the entry
      errors that would show up in traditional accounting. But it will flag
      transactions that are not balanced, and it will let you know when an
      account name is missing.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Calling this double-entry bookkeeping is a bit misleading; it
        would be somewhat more accurate to call it multiple- entry
        bookkeeping, since a transaction can affect more than two accounts.
        Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s 700 years of history of use of the term, which
        sufficiently discourages changing it.</para>

  <sect1 id="basics-entry1">
    <title>Data Entry Concepts</title>

    <para>When entering data in <application>&app;</application>, you should be aware of the 3 levels
    of organization in which <application>&app;</application> divides your data: files, accounts and
    transactions. These levels are presented in their order of complexity, one
    file contains many accounts and one account contains many transactions.
    This division is fundamental to understanding how to use <application>&app;</application>.</para>

    <sect2 id="basics-accounts2">
      <title>Files, Accounts and Transactions</title>

      <para><application>&app;</application> uses <emphasis>files</emphasis> for storing information.
      <application>&app;</application> provides three types of files: data files, backup files, and log
      files. The main file that you will use to store your data is a data
      file. You will probably have only one data file that you use for your
      home data, but <application>&app;</application> will automatically save a backup copy for you
      each time you save that data file. <application>&app;</application> also provides log files which
      can be used to help reconstruct data. Backup and log files are described
      in <xref linkend="basics-backup1" />.</para>

      <para>An <emphasis>account</emphasis> is a place for keeping track of
      what you own, owe, spend or receive. Although you only have one main
      data file, that file will contain many accounts. You probably already
      think of money you own or owe as being in an account. For example, at
      some point you opened checking and savings accounts at a particular
      bank, and that bank sends you monthly statements showing how much money
      you <emphasis>own</emphasis> in these accounts. Credit card accounts
      also send you statements showing what you <emphasis>owe</emphasis> to a
      credit card company, and the mortgage company may send you periodic
      statements showing how much you still <emphasis>owe</emphasis> on your
      loan.</para>

      <para>In <application>&app;</application>, accounts are also used to categorize money you receive
      or spend, even though these are not physical accounts that receive
      statements. As we will cover more in <xref linkend="chapter_accts"></xref>,
      income type accounts are
      used to categorize money received (like a paycheck), and expense type
      accounts are used to categorize money spent (for pizza, to pay a bill,
      etc.) These accounts function much like categories in some other
      financial programs, with a few advantages discussed in 
      <xref linkend="chapter_accts"></xref>.</para>

      <para>A <emphasis>transaction</emphasis> represents the movement of
      money from one account to another account. Whenever you spend or receive
      money, or transfer money between accounts, that is a transaction. In
      <application>&app;</application>, as we will see in the next section, transactions always involve
      at least two accounts. Examples of transactions are: paying a bill,
      transferring money from savings to checking, buying a pizza, withdrawing
      money, and depositing a paycheck. <xref linkend="chapter_txns"></xref> 
      goes more in depth on how to enter transactions in <application>&app;</application>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="basics-dbentry2">
      <title>Double Entry</title>

      <para>You&rsquo;ve probably heard the saying, <quote>Money doesn&rsquo;t grow on
      trees</quote>. It means that money must come from somewhere - it doesn&rsquo;t
      just <quote>appear</quote>. <emphasis>Double entry accounting
      </emphasis> is a method of record-keeping that lets you track just where
      your money comes from and where it goes. Using double entry means that
      money is never gained nor lost - an equal amount is always transferred
      from one place to another. When you withdraw cash, you are transferring
      money from your bank account to your wallet. When you write a check to
      the grocery store, you are transferring money from your checking account
      to the grocery store. And when you deposit a paycheck, you are
      transferring money from your source of income to your bank
      account.</para>

      <para>In <application>&app;</application>, these transfers are known as 
      <emphasis>transactions</emphasis>, and each
      transaction requires at least two accounts. To enter the cash
      withdrawal, for example, you would enter a transfer of money from a bank
      account to a cash account. You would record the grocery check as a
      transfer from a checking account to a groceries expense account. And the
      paycheck deposit is recorded as a transfer from an income account to a
      bank account.</para>

      <para>Unlike traditional accounting packages, <application>&app;</application> makes it very easy
      to enter your double entry transactions. <xref linkend="chapter_txns"></xref> 
      gives more detail on
      entering transactions, but for now let&rsquo;s take a general look at how they
      work. For a basic transaction like writing a check, you first create two
      accounts: a checking account and an account for the expense. For
      example, if you write a check to pay for groceries, then you need both a
      checking account and a groceries account. 
      (See <xref linkend="chapter_accts"></xref> for more detail
      on creating accounts.) To record the check, you simply enter a
      transaction to transfer money from the checking account to the groceries
      account. In this example, the <application>&app;</application> transactions look like this when
      viewed from the register windows of the checking account:</para>

      <para>In this transaction, a check is written to <guilabel>Grocery

      entry transaction, at least two accounts are affected and must be part

      name (<guilabel>Assets:Checking Account</guilabel>) for you so you only 
      enter the other account name affected

      <note>
        <para>In this example for double entry accounting we used a checking
        account to pay for the groceries. But, notice that concept is the same
        no matter what method you use to pay for the groceries. If instead you
        used a credit card, the double entry accounting would simply involve
        your Credit Card account instead of the Checking account.</para>
      </note>

      <para>What about your paycheck? You can see that money goes into a bank
      account, but where does it come from? In double-entry, the money has to
      come from somewhere. Technically, that money comes from your employer,
      but you don&rsquo;t care about tracking your employer&rsquo;s accounts. So how do
      you account for money coming in? In <application>&app;</application>, you create a special income
      type account to track your incoming paychecks. 
      (See <xref linkend="chapter_accts"></xref> for more
      information on creating income accounts.) To record the paychecks, you
      simply enter a transaction to transfer money from the income account to
      a bank account.</para>

      <para>Here&rsquo;s what a paycheck deposit looks like in <application>&app;</application>.</para>

      <screenshot id="basics-DoubleEntryIntro-salary">

            <para>This image shows entering the date, description and transfer
            account for a <guilabel>$600</guilabel> <guilabel>

            Us</guilabel>.</para>
          </caption>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>

      <para>In this example, <guilabel>$600</guilabel> is transferred from a
      <guilabel>Salary</guilabel> income account to the <guilabel>Checking
      Account</guilabel>. Because of the special nature of income accounts,
      discussed in <xref linkend="chapter_accts"></xref>, this transaction 
      increases both the checking account balance and the income account 
      balance by the amount transferred.</para>

      <para>So what if you want to record your gross pay and all the
      deductions that come out of your check as well? You enter a transaction
      with <emphasis>multiple splits</emphasis>, which we will cover in
      <xref linkend="txns-registers-multiaccount2"></xref>. 
      In this type of transaction, you are transferring a sum of
      money from one location to several locations. For any double entry
      transaction, the <emphasis>total</emphasis> amount of money transferred
      <emphasis>from</emphasis> accounts must equal the
      <emphasis>total</emphasis> amount transferred <emphasis>to</emphasis>
      other accounts.</para>

      <para>For example, your gross pay might be $1000, but only $655 of that
      gets deposited in your checking account. The remaining $345 is split
      between your deductions, such as federal taxes, FICA and state taxes.
      How do you account for this in <application>&app;</application>? First, you should have accounts
      set up for the gross income (salary), checking, and each of the
      deductions (See <xref linkend="chapter_accts"></xref>). 
      Then you enter a transaction to transfer
      $1000 from the <guilabel>Salary</guilabel> account to the other
      accounts: <guilabel>Checking Account</guilabel>,
      <guilabel>Federal</guilabel>, <guilabel>Medicare</guilabel>,
      <guilabel>Social Security</guilabel> and
      <guilabel>State/Province</guilabel>. Because this is a double entry
      transaction, the total amount transferred to these five accounts must
      equal the original $1000 total coming from the income account. We cover
      this type of transaction in more detail in 
      <xref linkend="chapter_txns"></xref>, but for now here&rsquo;s a peek at what 
      it looks like:</para>

            Salary</guilabel> payment from <guilabel>Employers R Us
            </guilabel>. This is then made into a split transaction to
            <guilabel>Checking Account</guilabel>, <guilabel>Federal
            </guilabel>, <guilabel>Medicare</guilabel>, <guilabel>Social

          </caption>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>

      <para>The main principle to remember is that there are at least two
      parts to every transaction, and the total amount transferred from a set
      of accounts must equal the total amount transferred to another set of
      accounts. When a transaction transfers an equal sum from accounts to
      other accounts, that transaction is said to be <emphasis>in
      balance</emphasis>. In <application>&app;</application>, as in double-entry accounting, you want
      to have all of your transactions in balance.</para>

      <para>Why is this important to you? If all of your transactions are in
      balance, then your money is all accounted for. <application>&app;</application> has a record of
      where that money came from and where it was used. By storing the names
      of all accounts involved in each transaction, you provide data that can
      be sorted and viewed in report form later. Reports allow you to see
      things like how much money you made for the year and where it all went,
      what your net worth is, and what your taxes might be for the year. The
      more information you provide when entering transactions, the more
      detailed your reports will be.</para>

      <note id="acc-terminology"> <!-- <sidebar> -->
        <title>Accounting Terminology</title>

        <para>Accountants use the terms <emphasis>debit</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>credit</emphasis> to describe whether money is being
        transferred <emphasis>to</emphasis> or <emphasis>from</emphasis> an
        account. Money is recorded in the debit column, which is always the
        left column, when it is being transferred <emphasis>to</emphasis> an
        account. Money is recorded in the credit column, which is always the
        right column, when it is being transferred <emphasis>from</emphasis>
        an account. Money always flows from the right column of one account to
        the left column of another account.</para>

        <para>The main rule of accounting is this: <emphasis>For every
        transaction, total debits must equal total credits.</emphasis> This is
        just another way of repeating the double entry rule, that for each
        transaction, the amount of money transferred <emphasis>from</emphasis>
        accounts must equal the amount transferred <emphasis>to</emphasis>
        other accounts</para>

        <para>You don&rsquo;t have to use the terms debit and credit to use <application>&app;</application>,
        however. <application>&app;</application> account registers default to common column headings
        such as deposit and withdrawal - if you are more comfortable with
        those headings, use them. If you prefer the credit and debit headings,

      <para>The Account Tree window provides an overview of the data contained
      in the current file. It contains a list of account names and their
      current balances. From this window, you can open any of the accounts.
      The individual account windows are called account registers. <application>&app;</application>
      allows you to have as many account registers open as you wish.</para>

      <para>At the top of this window is the title bar, which displays the
      file name (once you have saved the file.) Below that is the menu bar.
      You can access the menu options by either clicking on these menu
      headings or by using shortcuts and access keys (see <xref linkend="basics-shortcut2" />. 
      Next is the Toolbar, which contains buttons
      for the most common functions.</para>
      
      <para>The account tree appears below the Toolbar. Once you have
      started creating accounts, the account names will appear in the account
      tree. You can customize which headings show up by using the
      small <guiicon>down-arrow</guiicon> at the far right just above the account tree.</para>

      <para>The Account Register windows are used to enter and edit your

      register windows and how to
      enter data into them. For now, note that the parts of an account
      register window are similar to the parts of the account tree window
      described earlier. The title bar at the top contains the account name.
      Below that, the menu bar contains menu options related to the account
      register. Toolbar buttons simplify common data entry functions. The
      status bar at the bottom of the window, displays some account balances
      covered in <xref linkend="chapter_txns"></xref>. At the bottom of the 
      account register window,
      information appears about the current location of the cursor.</para>
      
      <note>
      <para>In the register windows, you can resize the various columns that 
        <application>&app;</application> displays, but keep in mind that 
        the description column will automatically expand to fill all unused

      <title>Toolbar Buttons</title>

      <para>Both the account tree window and the account register window
      contain Toolbar buttons. These buttons provide quick access to common
      functions such as <guibutton>Save</guibutton> and
      <guibutton>Open</guibutton> in the account tree window and
      <guibutton>Record</guibutton> and <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> in the

      the mouse pointer over that button, and you should see a description of
      the function appear.</para>

    <sect2 id="basics-options2">
      <title>Menu Items</title>

      <para>The account tree window and the account register window both
      contain menu headings in a menu bar. Clicking on a menu heading brings
      up the menu items for that heading.</para>

      <para>You can click on the account tree menu headings and then move the
      mouse pointer over the menu items to see what they do. As the pointer
      moves over a menu item, a description of the item appears in the lower
      left-hand corner of the window (inside the Status bar). To select a menu item, click on
      it.</para>

      <para>You can also access the most common menu items in a window by
      right-clicking the mouse anywhere in that window. In the account tree
      window, this will bring up a list of account items. In the account
      register window, this will bring up a list of transaction items.</para>

      <para>Other ways of accessing menu items are through keyboard shortcuts
      and access keys, described next.</para> </sect2>

    <sect2 id="basics-shortcut2">
      <title>Menu Shortcuts</title>

      <para>All of the menu items have access keys which are
      marked by underlined characters in the menu names. Pressing the
      <keycap>Alt</keycap> key with the underlined character in the menu
      heading will bring up the menu items for that heading. Once the menu
      items are displayed, type the underlined character in the menu item to
      activate it. For example, typing <keycombo><keycap>Alt</keycap>
      <keycap>F</keycap></keycombo> in the main window brings up the <guimenu>File</guimenu>
      menu, then typing <keycap>S</keycap> will save the file.  Access keys
      are fixed and may not be changed by users.</para>

      <para>Some of the more commonly used menu items also have shortcut keys
      that directly activate the command without having to traverse the menu
      structure.  These shortcuts typically use the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      key, although they can use any key combination.  Menu shortcuts are
      displayed at the end of each menu item.</para>

    <title>Importing QIF Files</title>

    <note>
      <para>This section tells you how to initially import data from other
      financial programs that use QIF (<trademark
      class="registered">Quicken</trademark> Interchange Format). 
<!--
      Section 11.5
      addresses importing QIF data from online bank statements.
-->
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>To import data from <trademark
    class="registered">Quicken</trademark>, MS Money, or other programs that
    use QIF(<trademark class="registered">Quicken</trademark> Interchange
    Format), you must first export your data to a QIF file. One way to do this
    is to export each account as a separate QIF file. An easier way, available
    in <trademark class="registered">Quicken</trademark> 98 and beyond, is to
    export all accounts at once into a single QIF file. Check your program&rsquo;s
    manual to determine if this option is available.</para>

    <para>Once your data is in QIF form, follow the easy 3-step import process
    described below. Before you get started, though, please note that part of
    the import process involves checking for duplicate transactions, so it is
    very important that you load <emphasis>all</emphasis> of your QIF files
    before importing. Duplicate transactions result when more than one account
    is involved. For example, if one of your transactions transferred money
    from savings to checking, you would end up with this same transaction
    recorded twice - once in the savings account and once in the checking
    account.</para>

        to a view comparing your QIF accounts with the corresponding <application>&app;</application>
        accounts created. To change an account name, select the row containing
        that account name and edit the name in the screen box provided. Click
        <guibutton>Forward</guibutton> when you have finished making changes, and
        proceed through a similar category matching process. QIF income and

      <para>Each time you save your data file, a backup copy will also be
      saved with the extension xac or gnucash. This backup file is a complete copy of
      your previous data file, and the filename format refers to the data
      file, year, month, day and time of the backup. For example, the filename
      <filename>gcashdata.20060414185747.xac</filename> indicates this is a

      <para>Each time you open a file in <application>&app;</application>, a <filename>.log</filename> is created and saved

      appears because the <filename>.LNK</filename> and <filename>.LCK</filename> files are still in your directory. It is
      safe to choose <guibutton>Yes</guibutton> to open the file, but you should delete the <filename>.LNK</filename> and
