 This chapter explains how to manage your loans with GnuCash. 
  </para>
 <sect1 id="loans_concepts1">
 <title>Basic Concepts</title>
 <para>A loan is defined as a financial transaction in which someone pays for the use of someone else's money.  There are many familiar examples of loans: credits cards, auto loans, house mortgages, or a business loan.</para>

 <sect2 id="loans_conceptsterms2">
 <title>Terminology</title>
  <para>
Before discussing tracking loan in GnuCash specifically, it will be helpful to present a glossary of terminology.  The terms presented below represent some of the basic concepts found concerning loans.  It is a good idea to become familiar with these terms, or at least, refer back to this list if you encounter an unfamiliar word in the later sections.
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Amortization</emphasis> - the repayment plan which will insure that a loan is eventually paid off, typically utilizing equal valued monthly payments.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Borrower</emphasis> - the person or company that receives the money from a loan.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Default</emphasis> - when a borrower fails to repay a loan according to the terms agreed upon with the lender.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Deferment</emphasis> - a temporary delay in the repayment of a loan.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Delinquency</emphasis> - is the term that refers to late payments.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Disbursement</emphasis> - amount of the loan paid to the borrower.  Some loans have multiple disbursements, meaning the borrower does not receive the full amount of the loan at one time.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Interest</emphasis> - the expense charged by the lender to the borrower for the use of the money loaned.  This is typically expressed in terms of a yearly percentage charged on the principal borrowed, known as the <emphasis>Annual Percentage Rate</emphasis> or APR.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Lender</emphasis> - the company or person who lends money to a borrower.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Loan Fee</emphasis> - a processing fee removed from the principal at the time the borrower receives a loan.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Principal</emphasis> - the original amount of the loan, or the amount of the original loan that is still owed.  When you make a monthly payment on a loan, part of the money pays the interest, and part pays the principal.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Promissory Note</emphasis> - the legal agreement between the borrower and lender concerning the loan.</para>
  </listitem>

 <title>Setting Up Accounts</title>
 <para>When a borrower obtains a loan, it is usually with the intention to make a purchase of something of value.  In fact, most loans require the borrower to buy some predetermined asset, such as a house.  This asset is insurance against the borrower defaulting on the loan.  There are, of course, examples of loans which do not necessarily have an associated high value asset, such as educational loans.</para>
  <para>For the account structure presented here, we will assume the loan was used to purchase a compensating asset.</para>
  <para>A loan is a liability, the interest you accrue on the loan is an on-going expense, and any administrative fees you may have to pay would be another expense.  The thing purchased with the money from a loan is an asset.  With these parameters, we can now present a basic loan account structure: </para>

  <literallayout>
Basic Loan Account Structure

-Asset
   -Bank Account
   -Asset Purchased
-Liability
   -Loan
-Expenses
   -Loan Interest
   -Loan Admin Fees

<para>GnuCash has a number of predefined loan account hierarchies available, including Car Loans and Home Mortgage Loans.  To access these predefined account structures, click on <guimenu>File</guimenu> -> <guimenu>New File</guimenu> and select the loan types in which you are interested.</para>

 <sect1 id="loans_mortgage1">
 <title>House Mortgage (How-To)</title>
 <para>A house mortgage can be setup using the account structure present in the previous section.</para>
 <para>As an example, assume you have $60k in you bank account, and you buy a $150k house.  The mortgage is charging 6% APR, and has administrative fees (closing costs, etc) of 3%.  You decide to put $50k down, and thus will need to borrow $103k, which will give you $100 after the closing costs are paid (3% of $100k).</para>
  <para>You accounts before borrowing the money:</para>

   <para>The purchase of the house is recorded with a split transaction in the Asset:House account, with $50k coming from the bank (IE: your down payment), and $100k coming from the Mortgage.  You can place the $3k closing costs in the same split.</para>

 <title>Calculations</title>
 <para>The calculations for determining loan specific values, such as periodic payment amounts, total payment, or interest rates can be complex.  Some complicating factors are that there exist different compounding methods or that the interest rates may be variable or fixed.  To help facilitate these calculations, GnuCash has a built-in Financial Calculator.  To access this, go to <guimenu>Tools</guimenu> -> <guimenu>Financial Calculator</guimenu>.</para>
 
 	<screenshot id="loans_fcalc">
	  <mediaobject>
	    <imageobject>

	      srccredit="Jon Lapham" format="PNG"/>

	    <caption>
	       <para>The Financial Calculator</para>
	    </caption>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot>

<para>The Financial Calculator can be used to calculate any one of the 5 parameters listed, given the other 4 parameters have been defined.  These 5 parameters are as follows:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Payment Periods</emphasis> - the total number of payments.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Interest Rate</emphasis> - the yearly interest rate of the loan.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Present Value</emphasis> - the current amount owed on the loan</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Periodic Payment</emphasis> - the amount to pay per period</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><emphasis>Future Value</emphasis> - the amount owed on the loan when finished</para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

<para>Additionally, you must select the frequency of compounding and the frequency of payments.  Typically, both of these will be "Monthly", but check the specifics of your loan.  Next you must specify whether payments are made at the beginning or end of a payment period.  Finally, you can specify whether the compounding is Discrete (ie: uses the compounding frequency to calculate) or Continuous.  Continuous compounding is the limit as the compounding period becomes smaller and smaller until it approaches zero.</para>

  <sect2 id="loans_calcsexample2">
  <title>Example: Monthly Payments</title>
  <para>What is your monthly payment on a $100000 30 year loan at a fixed rate of 4% compounded monthly?</para>
  <para>This scenario is shown in the example image above.  To perform this calculation, set Payment Periods to 360 (12 months x 30 years), Interest Rate to 4, Present Value to 100000, leave Periodic Payment empty and set Future Value to 0 (you do not want to owe anything at the end of the loan).  Compounding is Monthly, Payments are Monthly, assume End of Period Payments, and Discrete Compounding.  Now, click on the <guibutton>Calculate</guibutton> button next to the Periodic Payment area.  You should see -473.30.</para>
  <para>Answer: You must make monthly payments of 473.30.</para>
 </sect2>

  <sect2 id="loans_calcsexample2">
  <title>Example: Length of Loan</title>
<para>How long will you be paying back a $20000 loan at 10% fixed rate interest compounded monthly if you pay $500 per month?</para>
  <para>To perform this calculation, leave Payment Periods empty, set Interest Rate to 10, Present Value to 20000, Periodic Payment is -500, and set Future Value is 0 (you do not want to owe anything at the end of the loan).  Compounding is Monthly, Payments are Monthly, assume End of Period Payments, and Discrete Compounding.  Now, click on the <guibutton>Calculate</guibutton> button next to the Payment Periods area, you should calculate 48.</para>
   <para>Answer: You will pay off the loan in 4 years (48 months).</para>
