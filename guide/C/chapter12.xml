 <chapter id="chapter12">
 <title>Business: Accounts Payable</title>
 <para>Accounts Payable (or A/P) refers to the accounting of products or services which a company has bought and needs to pay off.</para>

  <sect1 id="bus_ap_concepts1">
  <title>Basic Concepts</title>
 <para>The accouting needs of a business can be quite different from that of a person.  Businesses have customers that owe money, vendors which are owed money, employee payroll, more complex tax laws, etc.  GnuCash offers some business oriented features to help facilitate these needs.</para>
  <para>This chapter will focus on Accounts Payable (or A/P).  A/P refers to the accounting of products or services that your company has bought, for which payment needs to be scheduled.</para>
   </sect1>

  <sect1 id="bus_ap_setup1">
  <title>Initial Setup</title>
  <para>To setup GnuCash to work with handling accounts payable for a company, there are 2 preliminary things that must be done.  The first thing to do is to build an appropriate Account Heirarchy and the second is to register the company in GnuCash.</para>

  <sect2 id="bus_ap_setupacct2">
  <title>Account Setup</title>
  <para>There are many different ways to setup a business account heirarchy.  You can start with the Business Accounts setup which is available from the New Account druid, or you could build one manually.  To access the prebuilt Business Accounts, start GnuCash and click on <guimenu>File</guimenu> -> <guimenu>New File</guimenu> and proceed until you see the list of available accounts, select Business Accounts.</para>
  <para>Most likely, the prebuilt Business Account heirarchy will not be perfect for your needs, you will need to perform some amount of manual adjustments for the accounts to function well with your situation.  This chapter will present example account structures which you can add to your existing accounts.</para>

  <para>Accounts Payable (or A/P) refers to products or services bought by the company for which payment has not yet been sent.  This is represented on the balance sheet as a liability, because the expectation is that you will have to pay for it.  To use GnuCash's integrated accounts payable system, you must first setup an account (usually a subaccount under Liabilities) defined with account type <emphasis>A/Payable</emphasis>.  It is within this account that the integrated A/P system will place transactions.</para>
  <literallayout>
Basic A/P Account Heirarchy:

-Assets
   -Bank
-Liabilities
   -Accounts Payable
-Expenses
   -AP Expenses
  </literallayout>

 <note>
 <para>Note that you will need to add real asset accounts and real expense accounts to this heirarchy.  But, the most important aspects of this heirarchy are that you need an expense account and an Accounts Payable account, with account type set to <emphasis>A/Payable</emphasis>.</para>
 </note>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="bus_ap_setupcname2">
  <title>Register Your Company in GnuCash</title>
  <para>After you have built your account structure, you will want to register the GnuCash file as belonging to your company.  To do so, add your Business Name, Address and GST number.  Click on <guimenu>File</guimenu> -> <guimenu>Properties</guimenu>.  Type the Business name and address, add an empty line and add the GST number: <quote>GST: 1234-5678RT</quote>.  Click <guilabel>OK</guilabel>.</para>
  </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="bus_ap_components1">
  <title>System Components</title>
  <para>GnuCash has an integrated accounts payable system.  The transactions generated by the A/P system will be placed within the Accounts Payable account, as a record of what occurs, but you do not directly work within this account.  Rather, you will principally be working with the 4 integrated GnuCash A/P application components, available from the submenu <guimenu>Business</guimenu> -> <guimenu>Vendors</guimenu>.  These 4 application components are:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
  <para><guilabel>Vendors</guilabel> are people or companies from which you buy products or services on credit.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><guilabel>Bills</guilabel> represent the physical bill you receive from a vendor, requesting payment.  A bill contains an itemized list of things you purchased.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><guilabel>Jobs</guilabel> (optional) is where you register Vendor Jobs, a grouping mechanism by which you can group bills to a particular vendor.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para><guilabel>Process Payments</guilabel> is where you register money payments to a vendor to whom you owe money.</para>
  </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>In the next 4 sections of this chapter, the above 4 application components will be introduced.</para>
