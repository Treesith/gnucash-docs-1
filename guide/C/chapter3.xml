<title>Organizing Your Accounts</title>
<para>
This chapter will discuss some useful concepts for organizing your accounts.  Since GnuCash does not impose any specific account tree layout, you are free to design your account structure in any manner you wish.  However, there are a few basic accounting concepts which you will probably want to follow when designing your accounts to maximize their utility.

<title>Basic Accounting Concepts</title>

<para>
In accounting, the basic types of accounts are <guilabel>Assets</guilabel>, <guilabel>Liabilities</guilabel>, <guilabel>Equity</guilabel>, <guilabel>Income</guilabel> and <guilabel>Expenses</guilabel>.  A basic understanding of each of these will facilitate your understanding of the organization of your accounts under GnuCash.  
</para>

<sect2 id="basic_acct_bsm2">
<title>Balance Sheet Accounts</title>
<para>
The three so-called <emphasis>Balance Sheet Accounts</emphasis> are <guilabel>Assets</guilabel>, <guilabel>Liabilities</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Equity</guilabel>.  Balance Sheet Accounts are used to track the changes in value of things you own or owe.
</para>
<para>
<guilabel>Assets</guilabel> is the group of things that you own.  Your assets could include a car, cash, a house, stocks, or anything else that has convertable value.  Convertable value means that theoretically you could sell the item for cash.
</para>
<para>
<guilabel>Liabilities</guilabel> is the group of things on which you owe money.  Your liabilities could include a car loan, a student loan, a mortgage, your investment margin account, or anything else which you must pay back at some time.
</para>
<para>
<guilabel>Equity</guilabel> is the same as "net worth." It represents what is left over after you subtract your liabilities from your assets.  It can be thought of as the portion of your assets that you own outright, without any debt.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="basic_ie2_acct">
<title>Income and Expense Accounts</title>
<para>
The two <guilabel>Income and Expense Accounts</guilabel> are used to increase or decrease the value of your accounts.  Thus, while the balance sheet accounts simply <emphasis>track</emphasis> the value of the things you own or owe, income and expense accounts allow you to <emphasis>change</emphasis> the value of these accounts.
</para>
<para>
<guilabel>Income</guilabel> is the payment you receive for your time, services you provide, or the use of your money.   When you receive a paycheck, for example, that check is a payment for labor you provided to an employer. Other examples of income include commissions, tips, dividend income from stocks, and interest income from bank accounts.  Income will always increase the value of your Assets and thus your Equity.
</para>
<para>
<guilabel>Expenses</guilabel> refer to money you spend to purchase goods or services provided by someone else.  Examples of expenses are a meal at a restaurant, rent, groceries, gas for your car, or tickets to see a play.  Expenses will always decrease your Equity.  If you pay for the expense immediately, you will decrease your Assets, whereas if you pay for the expense on credit you increase your Liabilities.

<title>Principle of Balance</title>
<para>
You may have notices that these basics of accounting have set up a dual system in which Assets are opposed to Liabilities.  This is the very heart of the double entry accounting system.  For every increase on one side of the equation, there must be an equal and opposite change on the other side.  This concept is known as the <emphasis>Principle of Balance</emphasis>, and is of fundamental importance for understanding GnuCash and other double entry accounting systems.
</para>

<sect1 id="types1">
<title>GnuCash Accounts</title>

<para>
In the previous section of this chapter the five account types found in basic accounting were introduced.  This section will show how the GnuCash definition of an account fits into this view of basic accounting. 
</para>
<para>
But first, let's begin with a definition of an <guilabel>account</guilabel> in GnuCash.  A GnuCash <guilabel>account</guilabel> is an entity which contains other subaccounts, or that contains <guilabel>transactions</guilabel>.  Since an account can contain other accounts, you often see <guilabel>account trees</guilabel> in GnuCash, in which logically associated accounts reside within a common parent account.  
</para>
<para>
A GnuCash account must have a unique name (that you assign) and one of the predefined GnuCash "account types".  There are 13 account types in GnuCash.  These 13 account types are based on the 5 basic accounting types, but allow for specialized tracking of some special accounts.  These account types are presented below.
</para>

<sect2 id="balance2">
<title>Balance Sheet Accounts</title>
<para>
The first balance sheet account we will examine is <emphasis>Assets</emphasis>, which, as you remember from the previous section, refers to things you own.
</para>
<para>
To help you organize your asset accounts and to simplify transaction entry, GnuCash supports several types of asset accounts:
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Cash</guilabel> Use this account to track the money you have on hand, in your wallet, in your piggybank, under your mattress, or wherever you choose to keep it handy.  This is the most <emphasis>liquid</emphasis>, or easily traded, type of asset.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Bank</guilabel> This account is used to track  your cash balance that you keep in institutions such as banks, credit unions, savings and loan, or brokerage firms - wherever someone else safeguards your money.   This is the second most <emphasis>liquid</emphasis> type of account, because you can easily convert it to cash on hand.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Stock</guilabel> Track your individual stocks and bonds using this type of account.   The stock account's register provides extra columns for entering number of shares and price of your investment.  With these types of assets, you may not be able to easily convert them to  cash unless you can find a buyer, and you are not guaranteed to get the same amount of cash you paid for them.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Mutual Fund</guilabel> This is similar to the stock account, except that it is used to track funds.  Its account register provides the same extra columns for entering share and price information.   Funds represent ownership shares of a variety of investments, and like stocks they do not offer any guaranteed cash value.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Currency</guilabel> If you trade other currencies as investments, you can use this type of account to keep track of them.  The register is similar to the stock register, except that you enter exchange rates instead of prices.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Asset</guilabel>  For personal finances, use this type of account to track "big-ticket" item purchases that significantly impact your net worth.  Generally, you can think of these as things you insure, such as a house, vehicles, jewelry, and other expensive belongings.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<tip>
<para>
For all GnuCash asset accounts, a <emphasis>debit</emphasis> (left-column value entry) increases the account balance and a <emphasis>credit</emphasis> (right-column value entry) decreases the balance.  (See note later in this chapter.)
</para>
</tip>
<para>
The second balance sheet account is <emphasis>Liabilities</emphasis>, which as you recall,  refers to what you owe, money you have borrowed and are obligated to pay back some day.  These represent the rights of your lenders to obtain repayment from you.   Tracking the liability balances lets you know how much debt you have at a given point in time.
</para>
<para>
GnuCash offers two liability account types:
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Credit Card</guilabel> Use this to track your credit card receipts and reconcile your credit card statements.   Credit cards represent a short-term loan that you are obligated to repay to the credit card company.  This type of account can also be used for other short-term loans such as a line of credit from your bank.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<guilabel>Liability</guilabel> Use this type of account for all other loans, generally larger long-term loans such as a mortgage or vehicle loan.  This account can help you keep track of how much you owe and how much you have already repaid.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<tip>
<para>
Liabilities in accounting act in an opposite manner from assets: <emphasis>credits</emphasis> (right-column value entries) increase liability account balances and <emphasis>debits</emphasis> (left-column value entries) decrease them.  (See note later in this chapter)
</para>
</tip>
<para>
The final balance sheet account is <emphasis>Equity</emphasis>, which is synonymous with "net worth".  It represents what is left over after you subtract your liabilities from your assets, so it is the portion of your assets that you own outright, without any debt. In GnuCash, use this type of account as the source of your opening bank balances, because these balances represent your beginning net worth.
</para>
<para>
There is only a single GnuCash equity account, called naturally enough, <guilabel>Equity</guilabel>.
</para>
<tip>
<para>
In equity accounts, credits increase account balances and debits decrease them.  (See note later in this chapter)
</para>
</tip>
<note>
<para>
The accounting equation that links balance-sheet accounts is Assets = Liabilities + Equity.  Another way to look at this is: Assets - Liabilities = Equity.  So, in common terms, the <emphasis>things you own</emphasis> minus the <emphasis>things you owe</emphasis> equals your <emphasis>net worth</emphasis>.
</para>
</note>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="income2">
<title>Income and Expense Accounts</title>
<para>
<emphasis>Income</emphasis> is the payment you receive for your time, services you provide, or the use of your money.   In GnuCash, use an <guilabel>Income</guilabel> type account to track these.
</para>
<tip>
<para>
Credits increase income account balances and debits decrease them.  As described in Chapter 2, credits represent money transferred <emphasis>from</emphasis> an account.   So in these special income accounts, when you transfer money <emphasis>from</emphasis> (credit) the income account to another account, the balance of the income account <emphasis>increases</emphasis>.  For example, when you deposit a paycheck and record the transaction as a transfer from an income account to a bank account, the balances of both accounts increase. 
</para>
</tip>
<para>
<emphasis>Expenses</emphasis> refer to money you spend to purchase goods or services provided by someone else.  In GnuCash, use an <guilabel>Expense</guilabel> type account to track your expenses.
</para>
<tip>
<para>
Debits increase expense account balances and credits decrease them. (See note later in this chapter.)
</para>
</tip>
<note>
<para>
When you subtract total expenses from total income for a time period, you get net income.  This net income is then added to the balance sheet as retained earnings, which is a type of <guilabel>Equity</guilabel> account.  

(Insert a chart that shows common accounts and recommended account types for these)
</para>
</note>

<sidebar><title>More on Debits and Credits</title>
<para>
Remember the terms debit and credit discussed in Chapter 2?  Contrary to popular belief and even some dictionary definitions,  accounting debits and credits do not mean decrease and increase.  The only constant definition of debits and credits is that debits are left-column entries and credits are right-column entries.  In fact, debits and credits each increase certain types of accounts and decrease others.    In asset and expense type accounts, debits increase the balance and credits decrease the balance.  In liability, equity and income type accounts, credits increase the balance and debits decrease the balance.
</para>
<para>
For example, debits <emphasis>increase</emphasis> your bank account balance and credits <emphasis>decrease</emphasis> your bank account balance.  Wait a minute, you might say, a <emphasis>debit</emphasis> card <emphasis>decreases</emphasis> the balance in my checking account, because I take money out of it.  And when the bank gives me money back on something, they <emphasis>credit</emphasis> my account. So why is this  reversed in accounting?
</para>
<para>
Banks report transactions from <emphasis>their</emphasis> perspective, not yours.  Their perspective is exactly opposite to yours.  To you, your bank account represents an asset, something you own.  To the bank, your bank account represents a loan, or liability,  because they owe you that money.  As explained in this chapter, asset and liability accounts are exact opposites in the way they behave.  In a liability account, debits <emphasis>decrease</emphasis> the balance and credits <emphasis>increase</emphasis> the balance.
</para>
<para>
When you take money out of your bank account, the balance in your account decreases.  To you, this is a decrease in an asset, so you <emphasis>credit</emphasis> your bank account.  To the bank, this is a decrease in a liability, so they <emphasis>debit</emphasis> your bank account.
</para>

   <title>Putting It All Together</title>
    <para>
Let's go through the process of building a common personal finance <emphasis>chart of accounts</emphasis> using the information we have learned from this chapter.  A chart of accounts is simply a new GnuCash file in which you groups your accounts to track your finances.  In building this chart of accounts, the first task is to divide the items you want to track into the basic account types of accounting.  This is fairly simple, let's go through an example. 
    </para>

  <sect2 id="examples_situation1">
   <title>Simple Example</title>
    <para>
Let us assume you have a checking and a savings account at a bank, and are employed and thus receive a paycheck.  You have a credit card (Visa), and you pay monthly utilities in the form of rent, phone, and electricity.  Naturally, you also need to buy groceries.  For now, we will not worry about how much money you have in the bank, how much you owe on the credit card, etc.  We want to simply build the framework for this chart of accounts.
    </para>
    <para>
Your <guilabel>assets</guilabel> would be the bank savings and checking account.  Your 
<guilabel>liabilities</guilabel> are the credit card.  Your <guilabel>Equity</guilabel> would be the starting values of your bank accounts and credit card (we do not have those amounts yet, but we kow they exist).  You have <guilabel>income</guilabel> in the form of a salary, and <guilabel>expenses</guilabel> in the form of groceries, rent, electricity, phone, and taxes (Federal, Social Security, Medicare) on your salary.  Simple, isn't it?
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="examples_toplevel1">
   <title>The Basic Top Level Accounts</title>
   <para>
Now, we must decide how you want to group these accounts.  Most likely, you want your assets groups together, your liabilities grouped together, your Equity grouped together, your income grouped together, and your expenses grouped together.  This is the most common way of building a GnuCash chart of accounts, and it is highly recommended that you always begin this way.

We can now add to this basic top-level tree structure by inserting some real transaction-holding subaccounts.  Notice that the tax accounts are placed within a subaccount named "Taxes".  You can make subaccounts within subaccounts.  This is typically done with a group of related accounts (such as tax accounts in this example).
