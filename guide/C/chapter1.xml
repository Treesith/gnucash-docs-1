   <title>Introduction to GnuCash</title>
    <para>
GnuCash is the personal finance software package made for you. It is versatile enough to keep track of all your financial information, from the simple to the very complex. It is one of the few financial software packages that supports global currencies, and it is the only Linux open-source program of its kind. And best of all, it is easy to use!
    </para>
    <para>
So what can GnuCash do for you? It can keep track of your finances in as much detail as you prefer. If you are just starting out, use GnuCash to keep track of your checkbook. You may then decide to track cash purchases, as well as credit card purchases, so you can better determine where your money is being spent. When you start investing, you can use GnuCash's investing features to help you monitor your portfolio. Buying a vehicle or a home? GnuCash can help you with planning the investment, as well as tracking loan payments. And if your financial records span the globe, GnuCash can provide all the multiple-currency support you need.
