<chapter id="Reports">
  <title>Reports And Charts</title>

     <note><para>This section is a "work in process" all of the material has not been reviewed for V2.0.
      While it may not be strictly accurate, it is at least a "guide".</para></note>

   <para>Reports and Charts give <application>&app;</application> the ability to present an overview of financial
    data in various ways. This can range from a simple summary of account totals to an
    advanced portfolio view. This section will present an explanation of the main <application>&app;</application>
    reports and how to adjust them.</para>

   <para><application>&app;</application> has classified the main types of reports into four major classes. These
    are all available under the Reports menu.</para>

     <sect1 id="report-general">
      <title>General Reports</title>

       <para>The General Reports include the Account Summary Report, Custom Reports, the Tax Schedule Report and <acronym>TXF</acronym> Export, and the Transaction Report and also the reports in the Sample &amp; Custom menu.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>Account Summary:</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem id="report-taxreport">
          <para>Tax Schedule Report and <acronym>TXF</acronym> Export: The tax schedule report lists all taxable income and deductible expense amounts used in the preparation of US Income Tax returns. The purpose of the report is to provide a complete audit trail for these amounts. The report is intended to be used by a tax payer to manually prepare his or her own tax return, or alternatively, to be provided to a tax preparer for that purpose. The report can also be used to generate an export of all tax related income and expenses to a <acronym>TXF</acronym> (Tax eXchange Format) file (this is in addition to exporting to the <acronym>HTML</acronym> format that all reports allow). The <acronym>TXF</acronym> file can be imported into tax filing programs such as TaxCut or TurboTax. The report should be run, inspected carefully for errors or omissions, and then corrections made to transactions, report settings, currency conversion rates or the account structure as needed. This process should be repeated as often as needed until all the amounts on the report are correct before a final version is used and saved along with the tax returns.</para>

          <para> For accounts specified in the report options (none = all) that are also flagged as <guilabel>Tax-related</guilabel>, all transactions for the time period selected (also in the report options) are included. The report sorts transactions by date within account providing subtotals by account within tax code within Form or Schedule line number. Support is also provided for multiple copies of and for sub-line items for selected Forms/Schedules. Optionally uses special date processing to include federal estimated tax payments after year end.</para>

          <para>All totals are in USD since this is the currency required for filing US Income Tax returns. Non-USD transaction amounts are converted to USD using the transaction conversion rate to USD, if available. If not, a conversion rate from the price database is used (either the date nearest the transaction date or nearest the report date as specified in the report options; if none is available, transaction amounts are converted to zero and the report provides a comment accordingly). A complete audit trail of conversions is provided.</para>

          <note><para>For this to work, the user has to segregate taxable and non taxable
           income to different accounts, as well as deductible and non deductible expenses.
           The Income Tax Information dialog is used for this. To access the Income Tax
           Information dialog go to <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Tax Report Options</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. The user
           also must set the <acronym>TXF</acronym> category of each tax related account. The Income Tax
           Information dialog is described in the <xref linkend="set-tax-options"></xref> section.</para></note>

        <para>Many reports share similar sorts of options. Some common ones include:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Report Name: Set the title of the report. This is also used to print the

          <listitem>
            <para>Date Options: Reports typically specify either a single date, or a date
             range, for the report. Dates can be specified in two ways, either directly
             (using the date selector), or by selecting a relative date from the menu.
             Relative dates allow you to specify dates like "Beginning of this year" or
             "Today".</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Step Size: This option is used on bar charts to determine the interval which
             each bar represents. Typical values are daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Accounts: Select the appropriate accounts for the report. Note that in some

          <listitem>
            <para>Depth: This option allows the selection of how many levels the report
             displays subaccounts. If the subaccounts go deeper than selected, an overall value
             for all the subaccounts is calculated and included in a total. To make sure every

          <listitem>
            <para>Style Sheet: Select a Style Sheet. Style sheets control how reports are

             <guilabel>Footer</guilabel> and <guilabel>Technicolor</guilabel>.

        <para><application>&app;</application> is able to print reports and to export the reports to <acronym>HTML</acronym> (web) pages. The
         Print <application>&app;</application> Document dialog is accessed from the <guibutton>Print</guibutton> button on the <emphasis>Toolbar</emphasis> or
         go to <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Print</guimenuitem></menuchoice> in the menu. To Export a report to a web page (<acronym>HTML</acronym>) select
         the <guibutton>Export</guibutton> button on the <emphasis>Toolbar</emphasis> and type in a file name.</para>


        <para>The Print <application>&app;</application> Document dialog is used to select which Printer to send the

         <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> to dismiss the Print dialog.</para>


        <para>Printing from an open register prints the Account Report, which is also called
         the Register Report. This lists transactions in the account with a total. Other
         reports print as viewed in the Report screen.</para>

      <sect1 id="report-create">
        <title>Creating Reports and Graphs</title>

             <note><para>This section may need updating !!!</para> </note>

        <para>It is possible to write reports if the current ones are not suitable. To do this
         you will need to know Scheme (a LISP-like programming language), and it is an
         excellent idea to have a copy of the <application>&app;</application> source code available. </para>

        <para>The reporting interface is documented in the source code file
         <filename>src/report/report-system/doc/report-html.txt</filename>. The file <filename>src/report/utility-reports/hello-world.scm</filename>
         in the <application>&app;</application> source distribution provides a good example of how reports are
         developed.</para>

        <para>It is also necessary to access data from the engine to get information for your
         report. This is performed by a set of Scheme wrapper functions that are documented in
         the file <filename>src/g-wrap/gnc.html</filename>. Examine some of the other reports in src/scm/report for
         an indication of how they are used.</para>

        <para>At present, reports are produced by calling a <acronym>HTML</acronym>-generation API, which outputs
         a dialect of <acronym>HTML</acronym> and rendering this with a <acronym>HTML</acronym> widget. This has limitations,
         particularly when trying to align objects precisely, as might be necessary for
         printing onto pre-printed invoices for example.</para>
